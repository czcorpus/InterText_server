<doc><s>+Eh+ thank you, mister president, firstly, my thanks to mister Samecki for his good work.</s><s>I think we all agree with the theme we're discussing here this morning, not only should it apply across the European Union but it sh~ should apply worldwide as well.</s><s>And this is something we discussed recently at the Canadian delegation, which is a step in the right direction.</s><s>But if we want that +eh+ utopian situation, we must ensure that the professional qualifications are of an equal standard across the European Union and worldwide, ideally.</s><s>And there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that, in some countries at least, when students haven't reached the educational standard to qualify for a course, they can go to another country and pay to do it there.</s><s>So there is need for independent verifiable evidence that the standards are equal and, if they are equal, then there is no excuse for not transposing this theme across the European Union and, hopefully, in due course, worldwide, to attain what we desire, free movement of professionals~ in labour.</s><s>Thank you very much.</s></doc>
